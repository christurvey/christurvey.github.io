                <h3>&amp;TLDR;</h3>
                The one where Chris created a video player that allowed for social and other annotations. Putting comments on a time stamp.<HR>
            <h3>Solution</h3>
            OTTO: Open Text Tool for Online Video Annotation. What a name; it just rolls off the tongue.<BR>
                The origins of the projects date back to a 2007 player that I had written in Adobe Flex called "Metagogy". This was going to be a 
                multimedia player that allowed for instructors to put post-it notes on videos. Having grown up in the time of the Encyclopedia; we used to receive a 
                "Yearbook" from the World Book Encyclopedia. When something major changed that year that rendered information in your volume obsolete the Encyclopedia company wanted the book up to date; in
                the "Yearbook" they would send stickers to paste in over the existing pages. While it was destructive to the book it was right for the information.
                <BR>
            OTTO was probably the most thought that I have ever put into a project. I was still pretty green in my skills for the first version
            in 2012 and by the time we shipped the final version OTTO3 in 2015 it was one that I knew my skills were going to get to the point
            where I could do it justice.<br>
        
                OTTO served as one of the many experiments that Rich Edwards and myself put out in the world as part of our collaboration with Turner Classic Movies.
                    <BR>
                        OTTO was offered to a small group of Professors in 2014 to test in their courses. Reviews were favorable. We ran the tests until the end of Fall of 2015 and have not revisited the project officially.<BR>
                            
                                Unofficially OTTO lives on and not much more will be said about it at this point. It will be back. Chris Turvey did meet with a University lawyer in 2019 and has permission to 
                                spin OTTO back up as his own project.

                    <h3>&amp;TLDR;</h3>
                The one where Chris created an amazing custom seed mixing piece of software that saved a company some serious money. The software Chris wrote won an industry award for a group of students. <HR>
                <h3>Solution</h3>
      I entered this project pretty late in the process. The team was at a loss on how to help out, they had the problems but didn't know how to proceed. An access database was being worked on by a student on the team. It was not going forward. I appreciated the effort.<br>
      I had worked with Adobe Flex a little bit on trying to put together an e-book reader for Kinesiology (The book never materialized as we lost our subject matter expert) and my early experiments with Metagogy (which became OTTO). The highly dynamic and calculation heavy job 
      was something I believed Adobe Flex to be up to the task. <br> 
      I did such a deep dive creating custom table cell renderers and inventing a single page application that didn't jar the users. As the iTunes cover parallax effect was popular at the time I jumped in and made creating a seed mix a straight forward story. At any time you could go back, but it would change the options ahead.
      You had to enter some basics about your land. Your land might have salt water near it. Your land might have a large deer population. Your soil might be more clay or sandy. You just had to tell NativeSpec which conditions you were living in and it would
      only show you seeds that would work in your soil.<BR>
        Some of the seeds that were selected were grass, some would have flowers. Some seeds needed to have a cover crop planted with them the first season in order for roots to be able to dig in deep enough, NaitveSpec took all of that into account. We also knew how many seeds were in an ounce,
        we calculated how much of any given seed was needed to cover an acre. Given an affinity for a particular plant we would create a mix and give real time feedback on how much it would take to cover the amount of land that was to be covered. As you were creating this mix it would also give you a price based on your current mix. While the calculation was to the nearest .0001 cent we displayed it with a Math.ceil to raise it to the next highest dollar. <BR>

            When we handed off the project the contact that was representing JFNew told the team that they just saved them $60,000 a year. They were able to train someone to create a mix in about 15 minutes.<BR>

      Adobe Flex outputs to the Flash Player. In 2010 the Flash Player was king and only the iPhone was not running it. Adobe Flash was installed on 99.6% of web browsers. It was huge. Adobe Flex had Adobe AIR which was able to create desktop applications. When we passed the application to JFNew they could run a desktop application to manage the backend. By the end of 2020 the Flash Player is dead.  Adobe Flex is also dead. I was quite proficient in Adobe Flex.<BR>
                The following fall we did create a stripped down version for their website that allowed for less pricing information up front. This stripped down version did rely on the same backend as the first version so it was quick to implement.<BR>
                    In 2015 JFNew contacted Building Better Communities asking for an update to the application as they had since merged with another seed company. I am not aware if this partnership was renewed.

                    <h3>&amp;TLDR;</h3>
                    The one where Chris created an innovated interface for teaching and learning for media minded people. Backend was cool. Visualization of how students used the platform made the platform shine!
                <HR>
              
                <h3>The Story</h3>
            A new area of the University was created in 2012. This new area was named iLearn. iLearn was an extension of the Division of Online Learning that was tasked to help faculty better teach their online courses.
            <br>
            Most of the day to day operations is set to help faculty teach their courses online and ensure they meet basic quality standards. Quality Matters was the yardstick inside of iLearn for minimally viable product courses. There are 100 possible points on QM. For iLearn to approve your course you had to get 96 of them.<BR> 
                
            Some of the faculty members approached Jennifer Bott (of whom was the Associate Provost for learning initiatives at the time) about getting some time from Rich Edwards and his development staff. The other member of the development staff already had a full plate so I attended the meeting.<br>
            Two faculty members and an Associate Dean asked us if we would work towards building a pretty LMS for them to host their classes.<br>
            We said yes.<br>
            We shouldn't have.<br>Ball State had been using the LMS of Blackboard since late 1999. <br>
            But we did say yes. So we worked through some mockups of some fairly standard things that must be included on the page. Working backward from Quality Matters standards. We asked if they needed this to work on phones as well. They didn't think it was necessary. They wanted something that could work on iPads and desktop machines.<br>
            I had seen a website that had a pretty amazing transition and the designer I was working with loved the smoothness of it. Isotope from Metafizzy became the building block to make this interface interesting and each lesson a single page.<br>
            Upon entering the site and selecting which course you were entering you would be presented with a curated list of articles for that course. You also had a menu that allowed you to navigate to the weekly topics.
            Once you were in the page a group of boxes that represented videos/articles/multimedia objects for you to experience were displayed. In this interface you also were presented with a "Todo list" which you self indicated that you were done with the tasks. All testing still had to take place back in Blackboard.<BR>
                The biggest issue with creating an LMS/CMS for us is that we were fighting an early May deadline. We didn't get on the project until late February. In April I was given a little relief in the form of someone else helping code the project. I kept trying to get them to embrace the power of AJAX but in the end we had to have a few page reloads.<BR>
                    We hit the Summer 1 release target with a few days to spare. We helped the faculty load in the 3 courses that were going to use the interface that summer. <BR>
                        A day before launch one of the faculty members asked me how they would know if a student were using the site. I wrote a few tracking hooks that evening and started tracking the users. Only for my eyes and their professors.
                        I built a viewer that was up to the minute tracking for faculty. It allowed for a visual of what article/element the user had visited and in what order.
                        I have an anonymous extract of that viewer data in the links. The final usage viewer is very similar to what is seen in the Context Usage Viewer link.
                        We really knocked it out of the park on this one. Even though we shouldn't have.<br>
                        I gave the faculty a method of creating new courses once they had logged in. We were set to turn off the interfaces in 2018 as the main program that was using the interface had been sunset. We had one faculty member still using the tool. Which warms my heart a little.<BR>
                            I got so good at creating sites with the tool that when I started my Google Developer Group that I would create mini-sites with the Context CMS/LMS.

                        <h3>&amp;TLDR;</h3>
                The one where Chris made four games. Three of them were in massive online courses. Hangman was the cool one. <HR>
                     <h3>Working though it</h3>
            There was a time that Ball State University was carving a place for itself as the entertainment MOOC generator. After our first Film Noire MOOC in 2013. Then a successful Gender in Comic MOOC. We had a few other major corporations on the phone
                    and they wanted BSU to run their massive classes. Ultimately we said no. We did return to Turner Classic Movies for several summers. Each summer ranging from just over 20,000 people signing up to over 30,000 in the largest year. The tracking 
                    we had on the games put it that between 6,000-8,000 players were seeing these games every week for five weeks. We had one complaint that the games didn't work and it was on the Dolphin browser on an e-paper nook. 
                    <BR>
                        The first game I wrote was called "For the Birds". Dr. Richard Edwards came into my office and told me, "I need a game... It needs to be related to Hitchcock. Can you have it before Friday?" (This was Wednesday.) I said I could.
                        I only really knew of the movie "The Birds". So I wrote a game called "For the Birds." Basically you try to live. You avoid birds. This game was going to fit into the LMS so it is basic skinned. 
                        Friday afternoon I show it to Rich and he asks me what the education value is. I guess I misunderstood. He was vague. We typically could read each other's minds. So I asked him what he wanted. He told me he wanted a hangman game. We worked out two other games that could be something to try.<BR>
                            By the end of the meeting I agreed that I could have three games to him in two weeks. But would give them to him when I got them done.<BR>
                                The first game. I thought about it for a few minutes. Hangman... Hangman... What makes the game hangman fun? I mean it is pretty dark. You basically end up killing a guy in order to get people to know vocabulary words.<BR>
                                    I took some inspiration to the most famous movie death in all of Hitchcock... "The Shower Scene"... I didn't have a budget... I didn't have an animator... and I didn't have the time. So I created a tool that allowed me to animate dots.
                                    I could transition dots and that would become the aesthetic for the game. Each image tells of something next to happen in the sequence. It was a hit. Dr. Edwards gave me a list of names to load for each week of the course. So that was done.
                                <BR> Game 2, it is a visual game. The name of the game was "Hitch or Hike" and it was a visual literacy game. We showed iconic screen stills from movies and you had to determine if the shot was from a Hitchcock film or not. So it is "Hitch" or it can "Take a Hike"...<BR>
                                    The third game tied into the Canvas LMS a little and originally was for class points but that was removed to keep the class fun. We could use the student LMS identity and their photo to play against other people in the course in the weekly quiz. We opted to make everyone play against Dr. Edwards as he also wrote the quiz... and he would score a fairly high score... it was in production and I was forced to make non breaking changes. 
                                    <BR>
                                        Once we hit our final year I decided that this would be something BSU would do forever so instead of animating towards the theme for the hangman game, I animated a projector catching on fire. Something bad has to happen in a game of Hangman... this game had a projector catching on fire and destroying a film. <BR> I used the Adobe Animator application to create the timeline assets and custom JavaScript to play the timeline back.
                                            When the course discussion boards talked about it there were several people that loved it and a few that said they were upset that Turner had hired a professional animator instead of the simple dot motif from the prior year. 
<BR>
    I did later return to the dot motif for a Social Media Renovation course that got its own hangman.

                        The one where Chris used d3js to create a few interlinked visualizations that could tell a data story.<HR>
                          <h3>Solution</h3>
                          I was given access to all student grades since... well a long time. I was told to visualize the data. Specifically I was asked to investigate grade inflation and see if I could find graduation trends in first and second year students.<BR>
                          Visualizing sizes of departments as they grew was also a nice view. <BR>
                            I didn't just get a data dump. I got access to a slow tool that already had generated reports. This project was as much an automation project with cron and curl as it was a data visualization project. In a few weeks I could answer the original questions. But I went further and created a platform that allowed others to dive deep into the data. Instead of just pumping our raw data I allowed for server side calculations and aggregate data. <BR>
                                With each visualization you pulled up you could dive deeper into other visualizations and data. Instead of destroying the current visualization with a new visualization I would add to the page and just down to a new graphic. This allowed for people to print out the "data story" that it took to generate their report. Each visualization when printed did have watermarked date as to when the data was current. <BR>
                                After showing it internally I was asked to put the project to the side as it might impact our ability to purchase Tableu or Pyramid BI.<BR>

                            <h3>&amp;TLDR;</h3>
                The one where Chris automates a job because we didn't have funding for a student to do it. <HR>
                          <h3>Solution</h3>
                        Wayne Mock had happened across a project from San Francisco State University called DART. DART allows for Decibel Analysis for Research in Teaching. DART has an interface that allows you to upload a raw recording from your classroom and can measure one of three states; single speaker, multiple speaker, or silence. Active learning is said to be happening with there are overlapping voices in a classroom. Given researchers estimates it is over 94% compared to a real life researcher sitting in the room taking notes. <BR>
                            For two semesters we had DART setup in two classrooms and we used a small amount of one of our Graduate Assistants time to get to a classroom and start a digital audio recorder. Then the student would make it back to the end of the class to turn the recorder off. All students had signed off on the recordings as did the staff.<BR>
                                During the summer of 2019 the Division of Strategic Learning put forth a budget that had assigned the Research and Development group a full time (20 hours a week) Graduate Assistant. This was revised a week later to 10 hours of a shared Graduate Assistant. This was revised two weeks later to 10 hours of an undergraduate student workers time. The final revision stood at no student being allocated to the Research and Development group. This information was handed down to us in late July.<BR>
                                    With a few semesters of data. We were going to continue with full time staff being the ones that chased down the recorders. <BR>
                                        I understand that budgets are tight... but as much as we as people want to solve the issues of making sure that the recorders are started for an expanded list of classes. We had talked to several faculty and had buy in, we were set to enter six classrooms in the fall of 2019.<BR>
                                            Our staff size wouldn't allow for us to start recording all six classrooms at the same time.<BR>
                                                I made a request for seven Raspberry Pi 4's. I could automate this. It will be easy. I will be able to start recording the first week of class if we get the Raspberry Pi's and microphones in before school starts.<BR>
                                                    We ordered the seven Raspberry Pi 4's and I got to work on automating the task. Of course we ordered garbage microphones, we sent them back and ordered new superior microphones. The first week of class deadline was missed. However we were able to get the full schedules of six classrooms recording starting the second week.<BR>

                                                           In September of 2019 Ball State hosted Dr. Melinda T. Owens, a UCSD faculty member and leading authority regarding the use of DART technology in active learning research. Dr. Owens couldn't believe the level of automation we had put around their tool.<BR>
                                                            She had that level of automation in early versions in her office but in order to make it more accessible to the world they opted for a web interface.<BR>
                                                                In my "Handy Dandy Links" portion of this writeup I would say that this script took a few days to refine. If I were given more time I would have extracted the resulting inline svg images out and stored them in a database. There is only so much time to dedicate.<BR>
                                                                    In the Summer of 2020 a pilot would have been run that would have used even lower priced sensors and would have used DART to validate the machine learning model. DART was about to be automated with real time charting. Due to COVID-19 and no in person

                            Before every GDG Muncie event I read the above statement as our mission statement that is mixed with our code of conduct. I genuinely wish to share what I know with those that will listen<BR><hr>
                          I was so lucky to attend Google I/O in 2009. I briefly met an awesome guy that was starting a program for Google called the Google Technology User Group (GTUG).
                          I had previous ran a Macromedia User Group... Adobe taking over Macromedia put a bit of an end to that program for me. I still loved the technology and the people I had met. The program just changed a bit.<BR>
                           I started a GTUG. We had two meetings. The first one was great. The second one was ok. There was a steep drop off. A third meeting didn't happen.<BR>
                               In 2013 I met back up with Van Riper (the guy that started the GTUG Program) in Portland Oregon. Both of us were in town for OSCON. I was curious about the conference and he was attending a two day community workshop before the show.
                               We had dinner at a Mediterranean restaurant and we talked about the tech industry and communities over naan, hummus and lamb meat. Van convinced me to give it another try. This time around the GTUG Program was branded to Google Developer Groups. I started having regular meetings. Mostly I wasn't around
                               other developers that much and I always feel like I can pluck smart things from other people.<BR>
                                   In the past few years I have given talks on WebVR, Arduino, Firebase, imposter syndrome and so many more topics. The worst feeling in the world is giving an imposter syndrome talk to an empty room. And luckily for me one person showed up. They were late. <BR>
                                       I have held events at Ball State University and in local co-working spaces. My largest attended 7 hour event had 52 people though the door. It isn't an impossible amount of people, but at the time it seemed like it.<BR>
                                        When I started the group in 2009 I was not that great at public speaking. I did enlist as many guest speakers as I could find to help out. Even in the 2013 reboot I was not much of a public speaker. I was super lucky to have my support network in GDG North America and I was able to work through it.
                                        I have given talks and been on discussion panels all over the world in such places as Muncie, Indiana; Tinos, Greece; San Francisco, California and Phoenix, Arizona.

                                        I have worked through a few of the Google Cloud Platform workshops. My six month goal is to become GCP certified on something. <BR>
                                            GDG Muncie has held a holiday party the past three years and it always brings a smile to my face to recall the events we held the previous year. <BR>
                                                During my dinner with Van he told me that if one or two or three people show up... it is enough; if it is the right people. When I look at the rag tag community 
                                                we have put together, it is the right people.
